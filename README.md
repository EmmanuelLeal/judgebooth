Interactive JudgeBooth
======================

This project provides a digital web-based version of the popular "Judge Booth" at bigger Magic: The Gathering(TM) events. Questions are pulled from a big spreadsheet and rendered with card images from [MTGImage.com](http://mtgimage.com/). The design is optimized for tablets and there is also an "Offline" mode for when you don't have internet at the site.
