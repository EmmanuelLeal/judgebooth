Interactive JudgeBooth
======================

This project provides a digital web-based version of the popular "Judge Booth" at bigger Magic: The Gathering(TM) events. Questions are pulled from a big spreadsheet and rendered with card images from [MTGImage.com](http://mtgimage.com/). The design is optimized for tablets and there is also an "Offline" mode for when you don't have internet at the site.

Printing
--------

If you want to print the question sheets, you should make sure that your browser is able to handle rendering and printing
250+ pages. Firefox or Chrome seem to be best suited for this task. Once the sheets have been generated, you can toggle
the list of answers by clicking on the text in the middle. Question sheets should be printed in landscape mode without borders.
